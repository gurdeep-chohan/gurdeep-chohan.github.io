This is a general blog containing random thoughts about different topics and subjects. I've chosen initially to organise this by date order rather than grouping the thoughts by category. I'll keep it as simple as possible for now but hopefully as the time goes on and the blog begins to take shape I can add structure, whether this is organising my thoughts by topics or some other categorisation. My methods and processes need real thought behind them rather than mindlessly or impulsively making changes. Don't forget to review and read what I've written and taking time to understand what I've written.

Built my 2nd ever PC which was operational on the 22nd July 2025. Here are the specs:

AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Desktop Processor [£409.00]  
MSI MAG B850M MORTAR WIFI [£199.99]

NZXT C1200 Gold ATX 3.1 [£159.98]  
Crucial T500 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD [£239.00]
