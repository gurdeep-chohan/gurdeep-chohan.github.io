This is a general blog containing random thoughts about different topics and subjects. I've chosen initially to organise this by date order rather than grouping the thoughts by category. I'll keep it as simple as possible for now but hopefully as the time goes on and the blog begins to take shape I can add structure, whether this is organising my thoughts by topics or some other categorisation. My methods and processes need real thought behind them rather than mindlessly or impulsively making changes. Don't forget to review and read what I've written and taking time to understand what I've written.
